Boss: Morning Employees! We have an important announcement today
Boss: Our enemies may be taken action against us! There have been reports of poisonous mushrooms in our biscuits! Some reports claim our biscuits killed an entire family. Luckily the cat survived!
Boss: Please check our new rainbow cookies for signs of poisonous mushrooms. Please ensure only the minimum daily allowable poison is accepted.
