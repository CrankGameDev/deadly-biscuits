Boss: Welcome Employees! Today we have an amazing new cookie! The rainbow freckle cookie!!!
Boss: Only one of the taste testing groups mysteriously died! So we think it will fly off the shelf!!!
Boss: Just to be safe though... Keep a close eye on those cookies for anything suspicious... If anything looks like a mushroom, burn it! 
Also... we received some... reports on the anzac buscuits... i think they were on drugs
