Boss: Welcome Employees! Today we have a fabulous new cookie! The rainbow freckle cookie!!!
Boss: Only one of the taste testing groups mysteriously died so we think it will fly off the shelf!!!
Boss: Just to be safe though... Keep a close eye on those cookies for anything suspicious...
Boss: Also, we received some bizarre reports on the ANZAC biscuits... \
I think they were on something...
Boss: Oh and watch out for any uh... fungi...
