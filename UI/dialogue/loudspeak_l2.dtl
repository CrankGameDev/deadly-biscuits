Good morning mi.. I mean employees! I hope you enjoyed your company mandated 8 hours of rest.
The local news reported our buscuits had bugs in them! Lies started by our enemies!
Still, please ensure only the socially acceptable amount of bug biscuits make it through quality assurance!
We canâ€™t get a reputation as the roach biscuit company again after paying all those bribes.\
