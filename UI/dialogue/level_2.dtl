Boss: Welcome Employees! We have some new quality assurance instructions today! Firstly a former employee has baked some doughnuts! Disgusting!
Boss: Make sure to burn them all! What kind of person eats a doughnut! Putrid!
Boss: For the "Made in Australia" crowd we have ANZAC biscuits! Lovely!
Boss: Finally, a rumor has been started about cockroaches being in our biscuits! Ridiculous!
Boss: Anyway! Kids today could do with the protein in cockroaches! Not the point! Just throw out any biscuits with any cockroaches!
